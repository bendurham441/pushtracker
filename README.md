# Pushtracker

This is a basic project I am creating to showcase my front end development skills. It is meant to track push-up progress over a long period of time and will provide statistics about averages and trends as the user progresses. This project makes use of React, React Router, and Formik. For now, all the data is "dummy" data since it is not connected to any back end, but I intend on creating one in the future, for practice.

## Start up instructions

To view this project, first install the necessary npm packages using `npm install` or `yarn`. This project makes use of parcel-bundler, so once dependencies are installed, start the project using `npm start` or `yarn start` which will automatically the parcel development environment.
